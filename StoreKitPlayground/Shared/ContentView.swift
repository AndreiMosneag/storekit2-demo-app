/*
 * Swift In-app Subscription Tutorial
 * Brief: A complete tutorial, using StoreKit 2, on how to get a decent subscription setup running in your app. Will cover the basic concepts, App Store Connect setup, how to add StoreKit, how to display and complete the purchase, how to verify the purchase, and how to handle changes that happen outside the app (renewal, cancellation, billing issue, etc). Good screenshots. It will also talk about the benefits and tradeoffs of having a server or not and eventually link to a post on the subject (to be written) It will link to other content we have such as “in-app subscription groups explained”, introductory offers, and any other content we have on deep dives. It will feature code samples with high readability and code highlighting, the code will be in Swift. It will also feature a downloadable, runnable sample app.
 * Goals: It should be better than the others our competitors have written, and be more succinct with better fit and finish and writing.
